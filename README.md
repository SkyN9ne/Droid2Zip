Easy collection of files from every supporting app into one zip-file while
being 'on the go' or offline.

This collecting "2go.zip"-file is like a suitcase where you can put things (files)
into from nearly everywhere (from every app that supports 'share'/'send')
and that can travel everywhere (via email, bluetooth, nfc).

 In the beginning this program was developed to collect new android calendar
 entries [ics-files](https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/de.k3b.android.calendar.ics.adapter)
 that should be transfered to the desktop-pcs-s calendar. <br/>

## Features:

* supports view/send/SendMultible for file(s), folder(s), urls and texts.
* automatic file-renaming in the zip if the same name with different file-date already exists.
* if settings/DebugMode is enabled processing is logged to logcat and to clipboard as text.
* Settings automatically pops up, if the zip folder is not writable.
* [Translations](https://crowdin.com/project/togozip) : bn, de, en, es, fr, hi, hu, id, ja, nl, no, pl, pt, tr, zh-CN, zh-TW
